  ## Description
  This application is designed to quickly and easily generate a professional Readme document for your project. You simply install inquirer, run the code and answer a few questions about your project. You are then presented with a readme file containing all your answers in a clear layout.


  ## Development Process
  This application uses Node and Inquirer. This is a second JS file to generate the markdown as well as package.json and gitignore files. 
  This is my first project working with Node, but I am exciting to continue to learn more about it and gain more confidence using it.
